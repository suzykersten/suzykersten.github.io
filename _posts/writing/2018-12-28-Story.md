```
I know your face,
that dress you wore.
But I can’t recall
your hair, your lore.

My memories paint torn
pictures, fractured. You, but 
behind stained glass.
It fits you.

I watch you through the glass,
straining to make anything out..
I can’t decide whether to
go outside or close the blinds.

Every emotion on the spectrum
you’ve brought up in me:
Love, lust, anger, empathy.
I don’t know if it’s me or you.

Even as I watch through the glass
you never pound, but never knock.
You respect me in my house, despite
the emotion ocean you have, too.

So many things divide us,
yet just as many bring us together.
You were my inspiration, my lover,
a thorn in my side.

I don’t want you gone.

But I don’t want you here, either.

Maybe we just need to lay back down
on your couch
and ignore each other.

Just enjoy the company
not of each other
but of a human.
