“Welcome to the first meeting of the Friends of Jacksonville State Park.” Peck’s voice dispersed into the thicket and was swallowed by the afternoon sun. Seven blank stares looked back at him, awkwardness dripping in the air. Peck started to clap, bringing a few others to slowly join in with a few pitiful claps of their own. Low turnout at this meeting was only the next concern in a long list of problems he was already fighting with.

The clapping died as painfully as it started. Another pause came, silent enough that you could hear the acorns falling from the trees. Peck lowered his hands and coughed. “I’m glad to see that you all still care for the wild, the historical, the primal places around you. We’re part of a dying breed, all of us, but I don’t want this place to die with us. As you all might know, these trails don’t get much traffic anymore. We need to bring new people into the park to make sure it survives for generations.” A couple of attendees nodded.

An older gentleman waved his hand in dismissal. “Sudden change of heart, eh? Well, I don’t see why the park isn’t good the way it already is. I like to be alone from the world when I’m here. After all, this place isn’t meant for us, it’s for nature. We just get to visit every now and then.” He pointed down to the small pile of candy wrappers, shoved in a plastic grocery bag, by his seat. “People mess it up enough as it is.” 

“In most circumstances, I’d agree, Jim. You know my stance on that,” Peck said. “In this case, though, I’m not the one making the decisions. To be blunt, higher ups don’t like the lack of an impact we have. Everyone wants history, exercise meetups, drum circles. They think these places are for us, and if we don’t get engagement up, then… well, I don’t know. Probably build some strip mall.” Peck sighed. “I’ve been trying to think of a way to satisfy both the park and the government, but always come up blank. That’s where this fellowship comes in. I’ve got a few ideas, but first, I want to hear any suggestions or events you all might have.” He opened his arms, looking around the circle with hopeful eyes.
Jim put his hand on his chin, muttering silently. “Government’s always been fools.”

No one answered Peck’s invitation for ideas. His shoulders slumped as he sighed, looking towards an older woman. “Didn’t you once say you took dance in college? You could do an intro to dance class-type thing, show them the basics.”
She shrugged. “Could try. Can’t guarantee results. Only took that as an elective.”

Jim scoffed. “Dance? Do you really think that’d save your job?”

“This isn’t just about me or my job, Jim, even if I do get my paycheck from here.” Peck moved on, pointing to the person next to her. “You wrote that book over ghosts. Was there anything ‘spectral’ here? Any cabins? Civil war soldiers?”
“Nope.” His response was drawn out, hanging in the air as if it was moving through molasses. He hadn’t moved from his slouched position during the answer, either. “Closest thing is 58 miles out at Worcester.”

“Are there any places even kind of similar to here? Any trails that resemble anywhere that’s haunted?”

“Nope.”

“Well, you could talk about ghosts that are in forests. I’m sure there are plenty of those.”

“Nope.”

Jim leaned back on the log he was using as a makeshift chair. “Maybe you could actually go clean some of those back trails and find a skeleton, bring some new ghost out here.”

“Shut it, Jim.” Peck put his hand up against his face, breathing a heavy sigh. “Blake, I’ll put your books on sale at the shop.”

“You know, now that you mention it, there were a few forest ghosts. I’ll talk about ol’ Bessy. Help the sales of my new book. I’ll even donate 5% back to here.” He had a smirk on his face as he leaned back.

Jim stared at Peck. “Don’t get them on the trails. It’d be bad enough with them mussing up the campgrounds.” He sat up, looking stern.

“Jim, nothing bad will happen. We’ve got some good stuff going here. I’ll let you all know the dates on those events when they’re set in stone.” Peck’s smile grew, getting a bit too wide. “If the trees could speak, I’m sure they would be singing your praise right now.” He picked up a stick and whacked on the makeshift podium in front of him. “Meeting adjourned.”

 

Jim turned his head to the side, looking into the woods behind him. From what he could see, no one was following him from the fellowship meeting. The dark poles of tree trunk shadows were growing longer by the minute. Night was coming quickly. He kept his pace slow and careful till the ground turned from mushy dirt to the hard-packed ground of the Fountain Trail. It wasn’t intended for people to cut through the woods behind the meeting grounds, but it was much faster than going back around to the trail’s entrance. Aided by the smoother terrain of the hiking trail, Jim quickened his steps. His breaths came quick, eyes darting back and forth between the trees. After several minutes of panicked hiking, he reached the pond.

A slow trickle of water came from the rock wall, creating a small pool of water by Jim’s feet. It wasn’t much of a pond, barely big enough for the few tadpoles swimming about. His gaze turned eastward, away from the pond, towards a plain looking part of the park. A few more glances around, then he nodded and walked several feet back into the woods, to a large tree stump. His breaths were fast as ever, eyes locked down on the ground. He broke. His breaths turned to whimpers, knees forced to the ground. Hands covered his face, tears rolling down his cheek. “God, David. They can’t. Not after all these years.”

His lone audience of marigolds stood tall, their only reaction a slight bend to the wind.

`--------`

The dull roar of an aging stereo bounced off the bark, filling the park’s meeting space with classical music. “And one, and two.” The instructor had a hint of annoyance in her voice with how each word was drawn out, low. Jim scoffed at the showing. Only six people had shown up for this second dance class. Still, it had been enough to make Peck want to keep it going. After one week, it was the only thing that had actually garnered any meaningful results.

Peck walked up beside Jim, his thumbs in the waistbands of his denim suspenders. “Enjoying the show again, Jim?”

“About as much as one can enjoy seeing a gathering entirely of left feet.”

“They’ve made lots of progress, you know.”

“How would you know? You didn’t come to the first one.”

“Well, I had more organizing to do. Have to make sure everything falls in right. Especially for the bonfire bash, a month isn’t as long as you’d think.”

“If by ‘organizing’, you mean getting other people to actually keep this all running. Heard that bonfire was all done by Jane and Marge, you just ok’d it.”

“Well, the first part of organizing is delegation. You have to put everyone where they’ll do best. They’re good at getting sponsors and food. My talent is people skills.” Peck smirked.

“Charming.” Jim stood up from the bench, staring off towards the start of the Fountain Trail. A small breeze came, blowing his hair back. With narrowed eyes, he turned back towards Peck. “Was there really no other way? You know how what happened back there by the second bend. Ain’t right for people to be stamping all over it.”

“I’ve had people look into it, and they’ve found no history of that being a lynching ground. Only a rumor. Don’t you think it’d be haunted if it really had that history?” He walked next to Jim, standing tall. “People going through there would be good. Help them see that it’s a nothing but a few trees and a bench.”

The low sigh from Jim was lost in the breeze. “Peck, people shouldn’t go there. It’s not safe.” his voice wavered at the end of his statement. Peck looked over, tilting his head.

“Don’t you go up there all the time?”

Jim turned away, walking towards the trail head. “I have my reasons.”

Peck watched Jim fade into the trees. He started walking towards the same trail, but was stopped by a woman before he could get very far. “Excuse me, aren’t you the head ranger around here?”

“Only ranger, ma’am.” He replied.

“Well, that explains things. There were two hooligans running around as I came in, throwing pinecones at birds over near the old railroad tracks. I tried to tell them off, but they wouldn’t have it. You’ve got to set them straight, ranger.”

Peck looked back towards the trails where Jim had gone to. He stared for a few moments before shaking his head and turning back to the woman. “Alright. I’ll go get them out of here.” He tipped his hat, heading off towards the front of the park.

`--------`

Jim looked out as a few burly men came and set up big wood logs in a triangle. His face turned to the start of the Fountain trail and he held up his hand, palm side forward. Cool air rushed at the back of his hand, indicating a North-East wind. Jim shivered as his hand fell down. Breaths became ragged as he stared out, whispering ‘David’ under his breath. A minute later, and he took a deep breath, standing tall and blinking slowly. “Fine, fine, it’ll be fine. It’s not till tomorrow. It’ll be fine.”

“Fine?” Peck said, walking up behind Jim. “Why, it’ll be amazing. Did you see how good they were doing during practice yesterday? It’s a wonderful dance, very classical.” Peck patted on Jim’s back. “Don’t worry, I’ll save a s’more for you. And we’ll have plenty of trash cans, so you won’t have to worry about coming to clean up the trails. Just because more people come doesn’t mean we’re going to let the place become a dump.”

Jim glared back at Peck, shoving his hand away. His eyebrows furrowed for a moment, but he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Peck just stared back, eyes wide.

“It’s not rubbish I’m worried about. It’s the people. They come and they terrorize the wildlife, trample the plants,” Jim said.
“There’s only been one case of people ‘mussying up’ things, actually. Just a few kids with pinecones and bad aim. That’s not bad for a few months, wouldn’t you say?”

“Something will happen. I can feel it.” He sighed.

“Well, you being here won’t change that feeling.” Peck replied. “Besides, why are you here today? You aren’t normally one to come out on Wednesday.”

“It’s also the 18th. I’ve got some business to attend to.”

Peck tilted his head, looking over at Jim. He was about to respond when one of the crewman dropped a log, yelping as it landed on his foot. Peck ran over, helping to lift it off and take care of the situation. When Peck looked back, Jim was gone.

`--------`

The soft earth bowed under Jim’s knees, still warmed by the afternoon sun. Faint sounds of the crewman finishing up setup for tomorrow’s bonfire echoed in the woods. Jim reached his hand down and cupped it around the few hidden marigolds, the same he had come to the night of the first meeting. He didn’t budge as Peck walked up, even with the heavy crunch of leaves and twigs. Peck stood behind Jim, placing a foot up on the tree stump next to Jim. “Something you aren’t telling me?”

Jim grabbed his cane and jabbed at Peck, pushing him away. He fell back onto the ground with a loud ‘oof’. Jim looked back, the glisten of tears still heavy on his face. “Stay back. You can’t ruin this place. Ruin him.”

“Christ, Jim, what’s gotten into you?” Peck pushed himself up to a sitting position. “What are you even talking about? I haven’t seen anyone on this trail for a few days.”

“They’ll be here, though. Who knows what a kid from your ‘ghost trail’ would do. Probably run over here and trample over him.”
“Trample what? The leaves the deer have been walking on for years? There’s nothing here, Jim.”

“That’s the problem. I’m the only one that even knows that David is still here. I’ve got to keep him safe.” Jim turned back towards the marigolds, cupping his hands around them.

“David?” Peck scratched the side of his head. “David Mcfarlane? God, he’s been gone for years. I haven’t heard anyone speak of him since high school. What’s he got to do with this?”

“You never heard the rumors? About what happened the last time we came up this trail?” Jim shook his head. “Probably best. I was a fool.” Jim sniffled as he looked back. Peck had stood up, walking over to him.

“You think anyone talked with me about it? I only ever overheard stuff about beer and hurt feelings.” Peck looked over the Jim, eyeing the flower buds in his hands. “Marigolds?” A short pause of silence filled the air. Peck tightened his hands into fists, shaking. “Is that what this is all about? This is why you come here all the time?”

“Marigolds, yes. Like those tales he told. But he was right, Peck, he was right. The connection to him does exist. I can feel it here, and it’s pure happiness. Nothing about the fight, about him leaving, about life. It’s just us.”

Peck slapped at the back of Jim’s head. Jim winced, bending forwards and covering the back of his head. “All this, just for some fairy tale that he’ll come back and you’ll marry by the marigolds? It’s been 40 years, Jim.”

“He said he’d come back!” Jim turned around, standing up and pushing at Peck.

Peck stumbled back, hitting his back on a tree. “You really think he’d want to come back here? I might not have heard the rumors, but everyone saw what happened when his parents found out. You remember his face. And you didn’t do anything. No one did. Why should he come back to that?”

Jim pointed back at Peck. “You have no right to judge me. We were all young and stupid. At least I make up for my past sins.”
“By tending to guilt disguised as flowers?” Peck stepped forward a bit, mouth wide as he started to say something. He stopped mid-word, staring straight at Jim, realization washing over his face. “My God. You’ve thrown your life away for this, and gotten nothing.”
“It can’t be for nothing. He will come back.”

Peck stepped forward again. “Or what? You’ll still be alone, like you always have been. He’s gone. You have to move on.”
“Liar!” Jim yelled as he rushed forward, lunging at Peck. He could feel the dirt being kicked up as he tackled Peck, causing them both to crash down against the leaves. The break of stems could barely be heard over the crash of their fall.

Peck pushed Jim off of him. Jim struggled to his feet, getting up on his hands and knees. He coughed and wheezed, shifting to his knees and pausing. By the time he got his breath, Peck was already standing, putting his hat back on. Jim looked back. Yellow buds of marigolds were crumpled midst the dead leaves.

“They’re gone, Jim. Move. On.” Peck shook a few leaves off his boot on his walk back towards the trail. He didn’t stay to see anything else. Jim was left in the cold, mouth agape and tears welling in his eyes, as the sun fell behind the horizon.

`--------`

Jim’s hands shook, covered in dirt. He scooped up another handful of soil. “There we go, David,” he said, placing the dying bud into the earth. The air grew colder as the dirt covered the flower, smothering it, locking it away. Jim patted on the grave till it was solid. His hands rested on top of the small hump for several minutes as he held back tears. He stood up, looked down at the ground. No trace of the flowers were left. Jim took a deep breath and started forward. It was the last time he ever was on the Fountain Trail.

`--------`

Somewhere in the world, a man put his hand over his chest. He felt an odd pang of regret, something he hadn’t felt in a while. It was gone just as fast as it had come. There wasn’t much time to ponder it, though. He was in the middle of telling a story of one of his many travels, and he couldn’t leave the dinner party hanging mid-tale.
