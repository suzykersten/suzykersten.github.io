# The Start of Something New

Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is my first foray into my own things not on any kind of pre-made social media. I'm going to drop down just my own musings on life, where I am as a developer, things I've learned, just a general mishmash of things and see what form it takes. 

I've found trying to force something never works, so this won't be a 'self-help' blog, a 'development' blog, or anything like that. This mostly started because over the past year, I found myself wanting to try out blogging and had several ideas for posts, so what better time to start than as I'm making my own website? 

I'd type more, but I have to go back to learning how to even set up this place with Jekyll and Github Pages and aaaaaah so many things. Do mind the pointy divs, I'm working on getting some css in here to fix that right up.
