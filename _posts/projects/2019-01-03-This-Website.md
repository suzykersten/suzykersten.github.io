# kersten.codes webpage

Dec 19, 2018 - Present

## What it is

A page on the internet that I built from the ground up to show who I am, showcase what I've done (both in tech and in writing) and to house a blog for my ramblings.

## Why I did it

I wanted to know what it's like to make a real, full project, not just a design, not a "functional" page for a class. I wanted to go through everything from design to implementation to getting a domain name, because I wanted to learn more about the entire process, not just bits and pieces.

Plus, I needed a way to post my writing and things I've done online. Things like Tumblr and Wordpress work fine, but I wanted full customize-ability. 

## How I did it

The design for the site was sketched out on paper, then made and colored in Adobe Xd.

The basis for the website implementation is Jekyll's static site generator. That uses html layouts to define how every page should look. The major pages are made in html, the blog posts are created in markdown and Jekyll handles making them into pages. Jekyll also handles 'compiling' the Sass/Scss files into css that I can use for styling.

Most of the styling comes from Bulma. Originially, I was using 100% my own css, but that wasn't responsive and was a lot of pain to make.

The domain came from namecheap, and it's hosted on GitHub Pages.

## What I learned

**Time management and how long it will take me to do something.** In a few seconds, I can think "oh, just make this a box with a few paragraphs that are centered.", so I think it should take like 5 minutes, but it takes like 30 to an hour when you factor in making it all be padded right, playing with the font sizes, having to google how to do a certain css thing... that adds up.

**Acceptance of "Good".** Looking at my site, I can see all of the problems that are there, the padding I couldn't get just right, the image that looked better in my head. I don't see the goodness of the design anymore because I've been staring at it for 10 hours, but it's still there. If it's good, that can be it. Don't die just trying to make it perfect, because as my web design teacher said, "There's always more to improve on, you have to step away at some point."

**Use the tools out there.** It isn't "cheating" to use a css framework like Bulma or Bootstrap. People use wordpress, and that isn't cheating. I'm relying on Chrome/Firefox to render my pages, that isn't cheating. Use what's out there if it fits what you need.

**Just use flexbox.** Everything modern supports it. No one looking to hire me is going to be using IE 6. Just. Use. Flexbox.

## One-word feeling about the project:

Relieved. I've been working a while on this and had it on my mind for a while, and it's done. I can easily add things on, the base is there and that's what I needed.
