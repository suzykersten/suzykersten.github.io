## What it is

Local Hack Day is a 12-hour hackathon, organized by MLH and run by local organizers throughout the world.

We had 12 people show up to the event, creating some amazing things, from a cube-runner game to a website to tell you what to do when you're bored. This is where I also built the Port-a-cade with help from Bryan Gaither.

## Why I did it

Having been to two hackathons during the Fall semester, I knew it would be amazing to have one at Austin Peay. While on twitter in late October, I saw MLH tweet out about Local Hack Day and how all you have to do is secure a venue and they'll provide some stickers and the check-in system. Get to have stickers, show more students the joy of a hackathon, and get experience organizing something for the first time? I was sold.

## How I did it

 I headed up the planning, aided by the ACM leaders for organizational support, Dr. Church and Dr. Nicholson for morale support, and the Computer Science Department and college of STEM for monetary and marketing support.

I delegated reserving rooms to Harrison, and I took care of making flyers and putting them up/sending them to Dr. Lee to spread to professors. Harrison helped choose on places to eat, and the CSCI dept paid for the food.

Bryan Gaither offered us his 'fantasy factory' of shop tools for anyone wanting to make something physical, which was all done when he contacted me after seeing a flyer up.

MLH provided the introduction video and giveaways we had at the start of the day. Everything else was really handled by the attendees until closing ceremonies, where Jeralyn Johnson took photos for the All State and I handed out awards.

## What I learned

**Trust other people, and accept their help when they offer it.** A few things fell through the cracks because I relied too much on myself, like awards at the end of the event. Part of me thinks always things will be messed up if I let other people do them, and I'll be stuck with the blame. Really, though, this whole event proves that wrong. Everyone made amazing projects on their own. Plus, if I try and do everything myself, I'll just end up being the one that messes some things up.

**Manage anxiety.** Close to the end of the day, I was feeling a bit stressed out. There were, however, several things I learned about tackling anxiety:

*  Before the event, I was scared. I didn't know how it would go, and I could only think of how things would go wrong. **Focusing my thinking of all the ways it could go right** helped keep my mind balanced, and gave me the drive to push through the possible hazards.
*  **Take breaths.** There's always time for a minute break, and it helps soothe the mind.

**A bit too much food is better than a bit too little food.**

## One-word feeling about the project:

Impressed. Everything came together in ways I never could have imagined, even with the few hiccups.
