## What it is

A bunch of wood, cut and nailed together in the shape of an arcade cabinet. It plays retro games, anything before the N64/Playstation is fair game for it.

## Why I did it

The previous week, the ACM had a setup in the Maynard Lobby to help people relieve stress before finals with some old retro games like Mario Kart 64. Setting it up and tearing it down was a pain, and it didn't look that fancy. Having a way to quickly get the arcade set up and look nice while also keeping the controllers in check was the main reason I wanted to build this.

## How I did it

During Local Hack Day, I went up to Bryan Gaither and pitched my idea. He was sold, and we started working on it that afternoon.

The screen is an old Dell monitor that Bryan Gaither donated, the speakers are an old pair I had that we hot-glued in, the controllers are basic snes usb controllers I found at a thrift store, and the games are powered by a Raspberry Pi running RetroPi. 

## What I learned

**You can't use everything at 100% efficiency.** Several times, we had to make cuts out of wood where the rest was just too small to do anything with. Once, Bryan even screwed together two boards were we wouldn't be using it to make the cut on the two boards exactly the same. Sometimes there will be a bit of waste, and that's ok.

**People are more apt to see the good things than the failures.** One controller just didn't want to work, I'm not sure why. People didn't focus on that though, they saw a cool arcade. I shouldn't focus on the failures either.

**Don't be afraid to ask.** I wasn't sure if it would be good to do this project. I had visions of it all failing, or me looking stupid for asking. None of that happened, though, and only amazing things came from me looking past my worries.

## One-word feeling about the project:

Pride. It feels very complete, even though I have plans to expand on it. Everything is nice and crisp and clean.
